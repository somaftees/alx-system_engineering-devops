Issue Summary:
Duration: February 27, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC - February 28, 2024, 2:00 PM UTC
Impact: The web application experienced intermittent downtime and performance degradation. Users were unable to access certain features and experienced slow response times. Approximately 30% of users were affected.

Timeline:

10:00 AM UTC: The issue was detected when multiple monitoring alerts were triggered, indicating high latency and increased error rates.
The engineering team was notified via the monitoring system and began investigating the problem.
Actions taken: The team initially focused on the backend services, assuming the issue was related to database connectivity or performance.
Misleading investigation paths: The team spent several hours investigating the database layer, optimizing queries, and scaling the database servers. However, these efforts did not resolve the issue.
2:00 PM UTC: As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for further investigation.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. Specifically, a recent deployment introduced incorrect routing rules, causing a subset of user requests to be directed to an unhealthy backend server pool.
Resolution: The load balancer configuration was corrected, and the routing rules were updated to ensure proper distribution of incoming traffic. Additionally, the backend server pool was thoroughly checked and restored to a healthy state. The fix was deployed incrementally to minimize user impact.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvement Opportunities:
Strengthen deployment processes: Implement stricter validation and testing procedures for load balancer configuration changes to prevent misconfigurations from being deployed to production.
Enhance monitoring and alerting: Set up additional monitoring checks to proactively identify load balancer misconfigurations and provide timely alerts to the engineering team.
Establish thorough rollback procedures: Develop a robust rollback plan to quickly revert configuration changes in case of unexpected issues.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a detailed review of the deployment process and update it to include more rigorous checks for load balancer configuration changes.
Enhance monitoring capabilities by adding specific checks for load balancer health and configuration consistency.
Develop and document a rollback plan for load balancer configuration changes, including testing and validation steps.
Conduct a post-incident review with the engineering and infrastructure teams to share lessons learned and identify additional preventive measures.
By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future and improve the overall stability and reliability of our web stack.
