What Happens When You Type “https://www.google.com” and Press Enter?
1. DNS Request (Domain Name System)
Your browser starts by sending a DNS query to a DNS server. The purpose is to translate the human-readable domain name (like google.com) into an IP address.
The DNS server responds with the IP address associated with google.com (e.g., 172.217.12.238).
2. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)
Armed with the IP address, your browser establishes a TCP/IP connection with the server at that address.
TCP ensures reliable data transmission by breaking down the data into packets, sending them, and reassembling them at the destination.
3. Firewall
If you have a firewall, it checks whether the request is allowed or blocked based on predefined rules.
Assuming all is well, the request proceeds.
4. HTTPS/SSL (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure / Secure Sockets Layer)
Since we typed https://, our browser knows to use a secure connection.
It initiates a TLS/SSL handshake with the server.
The server presents its SSL certificate, and the browser verifies its authenticity.
Once the handshake is complete, an encrypted channel is established.
5. Load Balancer
Google’s infrastructure is massive, and they use load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.
The load balancer ensures that no single server gets overwhelmed.
It routes your request to an available server.
6. Web Server
The selected server receives your request.
It processes the request, which might involve fetching HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, or other resources.
The server generates an HTML page containing the search bar, buttons, and other elements.
7. Application Server
Google’s application servers handle dynamic content.
They might interact with databases, perform complex calculations, or personalize search results.
These servers generate the actual search results page.
8. Database
Google’s databases store vast amounts of indexed data.
The application server queries these databases to retrieve relevant search results.
The databases are optimized for fast retrieval.
9. Response to Browser
The application server sends back the search results in HTML format.
The browser receives the response and renders the page.
Voilà! You see the familiar Google search page.
Conclusion
Next time you type https://www.google.com and press Enter, remember the intricate dance of DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases that work together to bring you those search results.
